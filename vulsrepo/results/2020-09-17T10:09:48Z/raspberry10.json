PostgreSQL maintains column statistics for tables. Certain statistics, such as histograms and lists of most common values, contain values taken from the column. PostgreSQL does not evaluate row security policies before consulting those statistics during query planning; an attacker can exploit this to read the most common values of certain columns. Affected columns are those for which the attacker has SELECT privilege and for which, in an ordinary query, row-level security prunes the set of rows visible to the attacker.","cvss2Score":4,"cvss2Vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N","cvss2Severity":"MEDIUM","cvss3Score":4.3,"cvss3Vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N","cvss3Severity":"MEDIUM","sourceLink":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10130","references":[{"source":"","link":"https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2019-10130","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/1939/","refID":""}],"cweIDs":["CWE-284"],"published":"2019-07-30T17:15:00Z","lastModified":"2019-10-09T23:44:00Z","mitigation":""}},"alertDict":{"ja":null,"en":null},"cpeURIs":["cpe:/a:postgresql:postgresql:9.6.2"]},"CVE-2019-10208":{"cveID":"CVE-2019-10208","confidences":[{"score":100,"detectionMethod":"CpeNameMatch"}],"cveContents":{"jvn":{"type":"jvn","cveID":"CVE-2019-10208","title":"Postgresql Windows インストーラにおける SQL インジェクションの脆弱性","summary":"Postgresql Windows インストーラには、SQL インジェクションの脆弱性が存在します。","cvss2Score":6.5,"cvss2Vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P","cvss2Severity":"Medium","cvss3Score":8.8,"cvss3Vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","cvss3Severity":"High","sourceLink":"https://jvndb.jvn.jp/ja/contents/2019/JVNDB-2019-011445.html","references":[{"source":"CVE","link":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-10208","refID":""},{"source":"NVD","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-10208","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://jvndb.jvn.jp/ja/cwe/CWE-89.html","refID":""}],"published":"2019-11-07T17:49:00+09:00","lastModified":"2019-11-07T17:49:00+09:00","mitigation":""},"nvd":{"type":"nvd","cveID":"CVE-2019-10208","title":"","summary":"A flaw was discovered in postgresql versions 9.4.x before 9.4.24, 9.5.x before 9.5.19, 9.6.x before 9.6.15, 10.x before 10.10 and 11.x before 11.5 where arbitrary SQL statements can be executed given a suitable SECURITY DEFINER function.

For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.
