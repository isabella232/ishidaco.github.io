An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.","cvss2Score":0,"cvss2Vector":"","cvss2Severity":"Medium","cvss3Score":0,"cvss3Vector":"","cvss3Severity":"Medium","sourceLink":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2018-20217","references":[{"source":"CVE","link":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20217","refID":"CVE-2018-20217"},{"source":"Ref","link":"http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2018/CVE-2018-20217.html","refID":""},{"source":"Ref","link":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2KNHELH4YHNT6H2ESJWX2UIDXLBNGB2O/","refID":""},{"source":"Bug","link":"http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=917387","refID":""},{"source":"Bug","link":"http://krbdev.mit.edu/rt/Ticket/Display.html?id=8763","refID":""}],"published":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","lastModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mitigation":""}},"alertDict":{"ja":null,"en":null}},"CVE-2018-20482":{"cveID":"CVE-2018-20482","confidences":[{"score":100,"detectionMethod":"OvalMatch"}],"affectedPackages":[{"name":"tar","notFixedYet":true,"fixState":"Not fixed yet"}],"cveContents":{"jvn":{"type":"jvn","cveID":"CVE-2018-20482","title":"GNU Tar における境界外読み取りに関する脆弱性","summary":"GNU Tar には、境界外読み取りに関する脆弱性が存在します。","cvss2Score":1.9,"cvss2Vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cvss2Severity":"Low","cvss3Score":4.7,"cvss3Vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","cvss3Severity":"Medium","sourceLink":"https://jvndb.jvn.jp/ja/contents/2018/JVNDB-2018-013792.html","references":[{"source":"CVE","link":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2018-20482","refID":""},{"source":"NVD","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20482","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/125.html","refID":""}],"published":"2019-03-01T19:52:00+09:00","lastModified":"2019-03-01T19:52:00+09:00","mitigation":""},"nvd":{"type":"nvd","cveID":"CVE-2018-20482","title":"","summary":"GNU Tar through 1.30, when --sparse is used, mishandles file shrinkage during read access, which allows local users to cause a denial of service (infinite read loop in sparse_dump_region in sparse.c) by modifying a file that is supposed to be archived by a different user's process (e.g., a system backup running as root).","cvss2Score":1.9,"cvss2Vector":"AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:N/A:P","cvss2Severity":"LOW","cvss3Score":4.7,"cvss3Vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H","cvss3Severity":"MEDIUM","sourceLink":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-20482","references":[{"source":"","link":"http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/tar.git/commit/?id=c15c42ccd1e2377945fd0414eca1a49294bff454","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2018-12/msg00023.html","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-04/msg00077.html","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/106354","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/12/msg00023.html","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18745431","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201903-05","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1076166645708668928","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/sysadmin/TarFindingTruncateBug","refID":""}],"cweIDs":["CWE-835"],"published":"2018-12-26T18:29:00Z","lastModified":"2019-10-03T00:03:00Z","mitigation":""},"ubuntu":{"type":"ubuntu","cveID":"CVE-2018-20482","title":"CVE-2018-20482 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) -

To do this, it will call memmove with the right pointers to the target and destination strings, but the lenMsg will now be interpreted as a huge value, causing a heap overflow.","cvss2Score":0,"cvss2Vector":"","cvss2Severity":"Low","cvss3Score":0,"cvss3Vector":"","cvss3Severity":"Low","sourceLink":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-17042","references":[{"source":"CVE","link":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17042","refID":"CVE-2019-17042"},{"source":"Ref","link":"http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-17042.html","refID":""},{"source":"Ref","link":"https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/pull/3883","refID":""},{"source":"Bug","link":"https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=942065","refID":""}],"published":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","lastModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mitigation":""}},"alertDict":{"ja":null,"en":null}},"CVE-2019-17113":{"cveID":"CVE-2019-17113","confidences":[{"score":100,"detectionMethod":"OvalMatch"}],"affectedPackages":[{"name":"libopenmpt0","notFixedYet":true,"fixState":"Not fixed yet"}],"cveContents":{"jvn":{"type":"jvn","cveID":"CVE-2019-17113","title":"libopenmpt における古典的バッファオーバーフローの脆弱性","summary":"libopenmpt には、古典的バッファオーバーフローの脆弱性が存在します。","cvss2Score":7.5,"cvss2Vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cvss2Severity":"High","cvss3Score":9.8,"cvss3Vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H","cvss3Severity":"Critical","sourceLink":"https://jvndb.jvn.jp/ja/contents/2019/JVNDB-2019-010488.html","references":[{"source":"CVE","link":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17113","refID":""},{"source":"NVD","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17113","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/120.html","refID":""}],"published":"2019-10-16T11:09:00+09:00","lastModified":"2019-10-16T11:09:00+09:00","mitigation":""},"nvd":{"type":"nvd","cveID":"CVE-2019-17113","title":"","summary":"In libopenmpt before 0.3.19 and 0.4.x before 0.4.9, ModPlug_InstrumentName and ModPlug_SampleName in libopenmpt_modplug.c do not restrict the lengths of libmodplug output-buffer strings in the C API, leading to a buffer overflow.","cvss2Score":7.5,"cvss2Vector":"AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P","cvss2Severity":"HIGH","cvss3Score":0,"cvss3Vector":"","cvss3Severity":"","sourceLink":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17113","references":[{"source":"","link":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00035.html","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-10/msg00044.html","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://github.com/OpenMPT/openmpt/commit/927688ddab43c2b203569de79407a899e734fabe","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://github.com/OpenMPT/openmpt/compare/libopenmpt-0.3.18...libopenmpt-0.3.19","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://github.com/OpenMPT/openmpt/compare/libopenmpt-0.4.8...libopenmpt-0.4.9","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://source.openmpt.org/browse/openmpt/trunk/OpenMPT/?op=revision\u0026rev=12127\u0026peg=12127","refID":""}],"cweIDs":["CWE-120"],"published":"2019-10-04T00:15:00Z","lastModified":"2019-10-10T21:15:00Z","mitigation":""},"ubuntu":{"type":"ubuntu","cveID":"CVE-2019-17113","title":"CVE-2019-17113 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (bionic) -

An attacker with command execution in the shell can use \"enable -f\" for runtime loading of a new builtin, which can be a shared object that calls setuid() and therefore regains privileges. However, binaries running with an effective UID of 0 are unaffected.","cvss2Score":0,"cvss2Vector":"","cvss2Severity":"Low","cvss3Score":0,"cvss3Vector":"","cvss3Severity":"Low","sourceLink":"http://people.ubuntu.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/CVE-2019-18276","references":[{"source":"CVE","link":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18276","refID":"CVE-2019-18276"},{"source":"Ref","link":"http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/2019/CVE-2019-18276.html","refID":""},{"source":"Ref","link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGtxJ8opa8","refID":""},{"source":"Bug","link":"https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1158028","refID":""}],"published":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","lastModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mitigation":""}},"alertDict":{"ja":null,"en":null}},"CVE-2019-18348":{"cveID":"CVE-2019-18348","confidences":[{"score":100,"detectionMethod":"OvalMatch"}],"affectedPackages":[{"name":"python3.7","notFixedYet":true,"fixState":"Not fixed yet"}],"cveContents":{"jvn":{"type":"jvn","cveID":"CVE-2019-18348","title":"Python におけるインジェクションに関する脆弱性","summary":"Python には、インジェクションに関する脆弱性が存在します。\n\n本脆弱性は、CVE-2019-9740 および CVE-2019-9947 と同様の脆弱性です。","cvss2Score":4.3,"cvss2Vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","cvss2Severity":"Medium","cvss3Score":6.1,"cvss3Vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N","cvss3Severity":"Medium","sourceLink":"https://jvndb.jvn.jp/ja/contents/2019/JVNDB-2019-011323.html","references":[{"source":"CVE","link":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-18348","refID":""},{"source":"NVD","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-18348","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/74.html","refID":""}],"published":"2019-11-01T17:53:00+09:00","lastModified":"2019-11-01T17:53:00+09:00","mitigation":""},"nvd":{"type":"nvd","cveID":"CVE-2019-18348","title":"","summary":"An issue was discovered in urllib2 in Python 2.x through 2.7.17 and urllib in Python 3.x through 3.8.0.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed. The most classic instantiations of this category of weakness are SQL injection and format string vulnerabilities."},"owaspTopTen2017":"","cweTopTwentyfive2019":"","sansTopTwentyfive":""},"770":{"en":{"cweID":"770","name":"Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling","description":"The software allocates a reusable resource or group of resources on behalf of an actor without imposing any restrictions on how many resources can be allocated, in violation of the intended security policy for that actor.","extendedDescription":""},"owaspTopTen2017":"","cweTopTwentyfive2019":"","sansTopTwentyfive":""},"772":{"en":{"cweID":"772","name":"Missing Release of Resource after Effective Lifetime","description":"The software does not release a resource after its effective lifetime has ended, i.e., after the resource is no longer needed.","extendedDescription":"When a resource is not released after use, it can allow attackers to cause a denial of service."},"owaspTopTen2017":"","cweTopTwentyfive2019":"21","sansTopTwentyfive":""},"776":{"en":{"cweID":"776","name":"Improper Restriction of Recursive Entity References in DTDs ('XML Entity Expansion')","description":"The software uses XML documents and allows their structure to be defined with a Document Type Definition (DTD), but it does not properly control the number of recursive definitions of entities.","extendedDescription":"If the DTD contains a large number of nested or recursive entities, this can lead to explosive growth of data when parsed, causing a denial of service."},"owaspTopTen2017":"","cweTopTwentyfive2019":"","sansTopTwentyfive":""},"787":{"en":{"cweID":"787","name":"Out-of-bounds Write","description":"The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.","extendedDescription":"This typically occurs when the pointer or its index is incremented or decremented to a position beyond the bounds of the buffer or when pointer arithmetic results in a position outside of the valid memory location to name a few.
