speculative execution of instructions past bounds check. The flaw relies on the presence of a precisely-defined instruction sequence in the privileged code and the fact that memory writes occur to an address which depends on the untrusted value. Such writes cause an update into the microprocessor's data cache even for speculatively executed instructions that never actually commit (retire).

This flaw effectively reverts a security feature in the kernel (in particular, the /proc/self/setgroups knob) to prevent this sort of privilege escalation.\nAn issue was discovered in newgidmap, in shadow-utils, that allows an unprivileged user to be placed in a user namespace where setgroups is permitted. An attacker could use this flaw to remove himself from a supplementary group, which may allow access to certain filesystem paths, if the administrator has used \"group blacklisting\" (e.g., chmod g-rwx) to restrict access to paths.","cvss2Score":0,"cvss2Vector":"","cvss2Severity":"","cvss3Score":4.4,"cvss3Vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N","cvss3Severity":"Moderate","sourceLink":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2018-7169","cweIDs":["CWE-271"],"published":"2017-11-14T00:00:00Z","lastModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mitigation":""}},"alertDict":{"ja":null,"en":null}},"CVE-2018-7648":{"cveID":"CVE-2018-7648","confidences":[{"score":100,"detectionMethod":"DebianSecurityTrackerMatch"}],"affectedPackages":[{"name":"libopenjp2-7","notFixedYet":true,"fixState":"open"}],"cveContents":{"debian_security_tracker":{"type":"debian_security_tracker","cveID":"CVE-2018-7648","title":"","summary":"An issue was discovered in mj2/opj_mj2_extract.c in OpenJPEG 2.3.0.

A raccoon attack exploits a flaw in the TLS specification which can lead to an attacker being able to compute the pre-master secret in connections which have used a Diffie-Hellman (DH) based ciphersuite. In such a case this would result in the attacker being able to eavesdrop on all encrypted communications sent over that TLS connection. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.","cvss2Score":0,"cvss2Vector":"","cvss2Severity":"","cvss3Score":5.9,"cvss3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","cvss3Severity":"Low","sourceLink":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-12413","references":[{"source":"","link":"Thorough Explanation can be found: https://raccoon-attack.com/RacoonAttack.pdf\nRaccoon Attack: Finding and Exploiting Most-Significant-Bit-Oracles in TLS-DH(E) by Robert Merget, Marcus Brinkmann, et al.","refID":""}],"cweIDs":["CWE-385","CWE-200"],"published":"2020-09-09T00:00:00Z","lastModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mitigation":"Any risk involving ECDHE key reuse on the nss server can be mitigated by setting the SSL_REUSE_SERVER_ECDHE_KEY socket option to PR_FALSE."}},"alertDict":{"ja":null,"en":null}},"CVE-2020-12695":{"cveID":"CVE-2020-12695","confidences":[{"score":100,"detectionMethod":"DebianSecurityTrackerMatch"}],"affectedPackages":[{"name":"wpasupplicant","notFixedYet":true,"fixState":"open"}],"cveContents":{"debian_security_tracker":{"type":"debian_security_tracker","cveID":"CVE-2020-12695","title":"","summary":"The Open Connectivity Foundation UPnP specification before 2020-04-17 does not forbid the acceptance of a subscription request with a delivery URL on a different network segment than the fully qualified event-subscription URL, aka the CallStranger issue.","cvss2Score":0,"cvss2Vector":"","cvss2Severity":"not yet assigned","cvss3Score":0,"cvss3Vector":"","cvss3Severity":"not yet assigned","sourceLink":"https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2020-12695","published":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","lastModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mitigation":"","optional":{"attack range":"local"}},"nvd":{"type":"nvd","cveID":"CVE-2020-12695","title":"","summary":"The Open Connectivity Foundation UPnP specification before 2020-04-17 does not forbid the acceptance of a subscription request with a delivery URL on a different network segment than the fully qualified event-subscription URL, aka the CallStranger issue.","cvss2Score":7.8,"cvss2Vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:P/I:N/A:C","cvss2Severity":"HIGH","cvss3Score":7.5,"cvss3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:H","cvss3Severity":"HIGH","sourceLink":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-12695","references":[{"source":"","link":"http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/158051/CallStranger-UPnP-Vulnerability-Checker.html","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2020/06/08/2","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://corelight.blog/2020/06/10/detecting-the-new-callstranger-upnp-vulnerability-with-zeek/","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://github.com/corelight/callstranger-detector","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://github.com/yunuscadirci/CallStranger","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/08/msg00011.html","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2020/08/msg00013.html","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/L3SHL4LOFGHJ3DIXSUIQELGVBDJ7V7LB/","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/MZDWHKGN3LMGSUEOAAVAMOD3IUIPJVOJ/","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/RQEYVY4D7LASH6AI4WK3IK2QBFHHF3Q2/","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://usn.ubuntu.com/4494-1/","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://www.callstranger.com","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/339275","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://www.tenable.com/blog/cve-2020-12695-callstranger-vulnerability-in-universal-plug-and-play-upnp-puts-billions-of","refID":""}],"cweIDs":["CWE-276"],"published":"2020-06-08T17:15:00Z","lastModified":"2020-09-16T18:15:00Z","mitigation":""},"redhat_api":{"type":"redhat_api","cveID":"CVE-2020-12695","title":"CVE-2020-12695 hostapd: UPnP SUBSCRIBE misbehavior in WPS AP","summary":"The Open Connectivity Foundation UPnP specification before 2020-04-17 does not forbid the acceptance of a subscription request with a delivery URL on a different network segment than the fully qualified event-subscription URL, aka the CallStranger issue.","cvss2Score":0,"cvss2Vector":"","cvss2Severity":"","cvss3Score":7.5,"cvss3Vector":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:H","cvss3Severity":"Moderate","sourceLink":"https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2020-12695","cweIDs":["CWE-20","CWE-400","CWE-918"],"published":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","lastModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mitigation":"To mitigate this flaw, close off the UPnP UDP port (usually 1900) and UPnP service ports from the Internet using a firewall.

It is the lack of verification of these assumptions for user-controlled input that leads to injection problems. Injection problems encompass a wide variety of issues -- all mitigated in very different ways and usually attempted in order to alter the control flow of the process. For this reason, the most effective way to discuss these weaknesses is to note the distinct features which classify them as injection weaknesses. The most important issue to note is that all injection problems share one thing in common -- i.e., they allow for the injection of control plane data into the user-controlled data plane. This means that the execution of the process may be altered by sending code in through legitimate data channels, using no other mechanism. While buffer overflows, and many other flaws, involve the use of some further issue to gain execution, injection problems need only for the data to be parsed.
