If the client gets into this state, incoming Application Data records will be ignored.\n1791225: CVE-2019-17023 nss: TLS 1.3 HelloRetryRequest downgrade request sets client into invalid state\n\nCVE-2019-17006:\n\t1775916: CVE-2019-17006 nss: Check length of inputs for cryptographic primitives\nA vulnerability was discovered in nss where input text length was not checked when using certain cryptographic primitives. This could lead to a heap-buffer overflow resulting in a crash and data leak. The highest threat is to confidentiality and integrity of data as well as system availability.\n\nCVE-2019-11756:\n\tA use-after-free flaw was found in Mozilla Network Security Services (NSS) related to PK11 session handling. An attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the user running the application compiled with NSS.\n1774835: CVE-2019-11756 nss: Use-after-free in sftk_FreeSession due to improper refcounting\n\nCVE-2019-11727:\n\t1730988: CVE-2019-11727 nss: PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures can be used for TLS 1.3\nA vulnerability exists where it possible to force Network Security Services (NSS) to sign CertificateVerify with PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures when those are the only ones advertised by server in CertificateRequest in TLS 1.3. PKCS#1 v1.5 signatures should not be used for TLS 1.3 messages. This vulnerability affects Firefox < 68.\n\nCVE-2019-11719:\n\tWhen importing a curve25519 private key in PKCS#8format with leading 0x00 bytes, it is possible to trigger an out-of-bounds read in the Network Security Services (NSS) library. This could lead to information disclosure. This vulnerability affects Firefox ESR < 60.8, Firefox < 68, and Thunderbird < 60.8.\n1728436: CVE-2019-11719 nss: Out-of-bounds read when importing curve25519 private key\n","cvss2Score":0,"cvss2Vector":"","cvss2Severity":"medium","cvss3Score":0,"cvss3Vector":"","cvss3Severity":"medium","sourceLink":"","references":[{"source":"cve","link":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-6829","refID":"CVE-2020-6829"},{"source":"cve","link":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12400","refID":"CVE-2020-12400"},{"source":"cve","link":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17023","refID":"CVE-2019-17023"},{"source":"cve","link":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17006","refID":"CVE-2019-17006"},{"source":"cve","link":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11727","refID":"CVE-2019-11727"},{"source":"cve","link":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11756","refID":"CVE-2019-11756"},{"source":"cve","link":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12402","refID":"CVE-2020-12402"},{"source":"cve","link":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12401","refID":"CVE-2020-12401"},{"source":"cve","link":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-11719","refID":"CVE-2019-11719"},{"source":"cve","link":"http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-12403","refID":"CVE-2020-12403"}],"published":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","lastModified":"2020-11-09T21:03:00Z","mitigation":""},"jvn":{"type":"jvn","cveID":"CVE-2019-17023","title":"Firefox における認証に関する脆弱性","summary":"Firefox には、認証に関する脆弱性が存在します。","cvss2Score":4.3,"cvss2Vector":"AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N","cvss2Severity":"Medium","cvss3Score":6.5,"cvss3Vector":"CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:N","cvss3Severity":"Medium","sourceLink":"https://jvndb.jvn.jp/ja/contents/2019/JVNDB-2019-013969.html","references":[{"source":"CVE","link":"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2019-17023","refID":""},{"source":"NVD","link":"https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-17023","refID":""},{"source":"","link":"https://jvndb.jvn.jp/ja/cwe/CWE-287.html","refID":""}],"published":"2020-01-23T09:58:00+09:00","lastModified":"2020-01-23T09:58:00+09:00","mitigation":""},"nvd":{"type":"nvd","cveID":"CVE-2019-17023","title":"","summary":"After a HelloRetryRequest has been sent, the client may negotiate a lower protocol that TLS 1.3, resulting in an invalid state transition in the TLS State Machine.
